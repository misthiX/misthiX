# Hi, I'm Misthi 👋

I'm an aspiring Computer Science student from India, currently exploring programming through [CS50x by Harvard](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/). I’m deeply interested in algorithms, physics, and the power of STEM education to transform learning.

---

## 🔭 What I'm Working On
- Completing **CS50x** and building real-world CS projects
- Preparing for the **NSEP (Physics Olympiad)** and **SAT**
- Teaching science and coding to underprivileged students through my initiative **CurioCore**
- Planning to build a strong GitHub portfolio of clean, open-source projects

---

## 💡 Interests
- Algorithms and problem-solving  
- Physics simulations and educational tools  
- Tech for social good  
- Teaching & simplifying STEM concepts  

---

## 🧠 Current Learning
- C, Python, and the foundations of computer science  
- How to build projects with clean, well-documented code  
- Writing effective essays and preparing a strong college application  

---

## 📂 Featured Repositories (Coming Soon)
- `cs50x-projects/` — My completed problem sets and final project from CS50x
- `CurioCore/` — Lesson plans and teaching resources for local students
- `sat-prep-notes/` — Study notes and problem-solving tips from my SAT prep journey
