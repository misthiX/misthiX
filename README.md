## 🚀 About Me
I'm a high school student from India preparing for **JEE 2026**, while building a strong global undergraduate application for **Computer Science (NUS, NTU, US universities)**.

I love solving problems that combine **physics, math, and programming**.  
Right now, I’m working on beginner–friendly but smart projects that show real initiative and technical curiosity.

## 🔭 Current Major Project: Physics Problem Solver
A toolkit that helps students visualize physics numericals through:
- ⚡ Projectile motion animation  
- ⚡ LCR circuit simulation  
- ⚡ Electric fields / vectors  
- ⚡ Graphs and step-by-step solutions  
- ⚡ Interactive inputs for any physics question  

**Technologies:** Python, JavaScript, CS50 libraries (later Flask)

This is the main project I’ll highlight on my university applications.
