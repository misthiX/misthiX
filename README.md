## 🔬 Featured Project: Physics Problem Solver
A custom project where I combine **coding + physics** to build a tool that:
- Solves physics problems (projectile motion, circuits, etc.)
- Visualizes concepts using **animations and simulations**
- Helps learners understand motion, forces, and equations intuitively

📁 Folder: `physics-solver/`

Upcoming features:
- Projectile motion visualizer
- LCR circuit animation
- Electric field line mapper
- Numerical solvers

---

## 🏆 Competitive Programming
Actively practicing algorithmic thinking and participating in contests.

Platforms:
- CodeChef
- LeetCode
- AtCoder

📁 Solutions stored under `coding-contests/`.
